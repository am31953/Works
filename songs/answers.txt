If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Aura could be characterized by obtaining an average of "danceability", "valence", "tempo" of all songs, and then getting this "aura" average by tweaking this mentioned averages.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This aura might not be representative of the listener in the way that maybe 100 songs are not exact enough to represent the mood of a person.
Besides that, there might be other factors or components of a song to take into account to represent an "aura", in order to calculate the mood of a specific listener.
